# Ophthalmoscope




## Description
Our team has successfully developed an advanced ophthalmoscope with enhanced features for improved eye examinations. In addition to the traditional functionalities, our ophthalmoscope incorporates buttons to control light intensity and a built-in buzzer that alerts doctors when they are at an unsuitable distance, causing vision difficulties based on the lens's focal length.To showcase our project's achievements, we have created a comprehensive poster that highlights the key details and findings.
